#Architecture and Data Flow
Shared Components: To promote code reusability, you created a shared components module and imported it into other modules, ensuring new components can be shared easily in the future.

Reactive Data Handling: The application uses an observable named holdingsList$ to fetch data. This observable calls a getStocks() method.

Initial Data Fetch: On component initialization, holdingsList$ is subscribed to and fetchHoldings() is called to trigger the initial data retrieval. This reactive pattern ensures the UI is always up to date with the latest data.

Data Refresh: The fetchHoldings() method is a reusable function that can be called again (e.g., after a new holding is purchased) to refresh the data displayed in the UI.

#Holding Updates and Functionality
Purchase Logic: The planned update for buying a new holding involves a POST request to an endpoint. Upon a successful transaction, you would re-run fetchHoldings() to refresh the data list and the total equity value.

Total Equity Calculation: The total equity value is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of shares for each holding and then summing these values.

Incomplete Features: Due to time constraints, the sliding button for holding updates was not implemented, and the logic to update holdings after a purchase is pending. The discover page is also incomplete but is planned to consume a public stocks API to enable search functionality.

#UI/UX and Styling
UI Framework: You leveraged Ionic components to quickly build the user interface, acknowledging this was your first time using the framework.

Styling: Global styles were not fully implemented due to time constraints, and you noted that you did not have time to style individual components from scratch.

Animations: The animation for buying a new holding is in place, but the underlying update functionality is not yet connected.
